# JS-game
⭐️ Game (paper-scissors-rock) is meant to be played entirely in the console</br>
⭐️ Bonus questions about Javascript</br>
⭐️ Code is separated in 4 differents files to keep organisation optimal</br>
⭐️ One file is the root file for playing the game, another file keeps the helpers functions, a third file for constants and rules, and the last file stores the classes for the player instance and the player data</br>
⭐️ Use of Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming</br>
⭐️ Documenting code with JsDoc</br>
⭐️ Ranking with results populated from sessionStorage</br>
⭐️ Unicity constraint on the name in the records</br></br>
👍 Any suggestion is welcome</br>
